# Day 1 of JS30

## Things I got done
- Added drum sounds functionaly per keyboard press (home row mapping)
- Added opensource sounds
- Reactive labels

## Realizations
I need to revisit my fundamentals.

Before starting, I didn't watch the full day 1 video, I just saw the thumbnail with the labeled drum divs and said "I think I can make this in 10 mins", well, several 10 mins later I finished~ whewww... Key realizations I made is 1. if you have a clear goal in mind you won't get overwhelmed (based on my day job experience and this day 1 project). 2. Know where to search. (I limited myself to only access MDN docs for this). and lastly 3. Know your language, a few years (3) in using js and ts for just react stuff made me overlook some nifty built in classes that JS offers. One of them is Audio().

Additionally, knowing the fundamentals will also make you work several times faster. I.e., CSS, I got used to tailwind that I forgot some css syntax lol!

TLDR: Know your language, master your fundamentals, and plan ahead.

## What to improve next
Learning and mastering the fundamentals. Indeed fundamentals are the key when trying to do anything. Yes you have your tools like auto complete, llms, etc., but how can you build and architect effective solutions if you don't know your... guess what... fundamentals!

### Tools Used
- neovim
- lsp for js, html, css
- tmux for terminal management (makes me feel like hackerman lol)
- of course, a browser (I use Arc in Mac)
